# offical tutorial

## this project was created by create-react-app

It's a tic-tac-toe game that:

- lets you play tic-tac-toe,
- indicates when one player has won the game,
- stores the history of moves during the game,
- allows players to jump back in time to see older versions of the game board.

## todo:
- [x] Display the move locations in the format "(1, 3)" instead of "6".
- [ ] Bold the currently-selected item in the move list.
- [x] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
